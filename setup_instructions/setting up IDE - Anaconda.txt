1. download & install anaconda

2. add these paths to system environment $PATH to be able to run Python, Pip and Conda in cmd shell
	- C:\Users\*_*\anaconda3
	- C:\Users\*_*\anaconda3\Scripts

	*For Mac*
	- sudo nano /etc/paths
	- add ananconda installed path into the file, save and exit
	- restart Terminal

3. copy the following from .\Library\bin to .\DLLs to be able to USE conda and pip in cmd shell
	- libcrypto-1_1-x64.dll
	- libssl-1_1-x64.dll
	** PyQt5 designer exe is also in the same folder

4. update all conda/python packages
	- run -> Conda update --all

5. Conda needs to be 'activated' to properly import scripts in the shell (eg. CMD/Terminal).
	- in CMD, run 'conda init cmd.exe' --> run 'conda activate'
